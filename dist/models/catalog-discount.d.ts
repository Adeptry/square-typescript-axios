For example, in many US jurisdictions, a manufacturer coupon or instant rebate reduces the price a customer pays but does not reduce the sale price used to calculate how much sales tax is due. In this case, the discount representing that manufacturer coupon should have `DO_NOT_MODIFY_TAX_BASIS` for this field.
